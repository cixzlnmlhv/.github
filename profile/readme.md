Just got out of Squad 36. Wow, my head is still spinning like a blender with no lid. Can’t even wrap my mind around it properly. The 𝐭𝗁𝐞𝖺𝐭𝖾𝗋 was a swampy sea of murmurs, and that popcorn - more like rock-corn, managed to stab my gums. Ugh. There's still a crunchy graveyard in my seat.

Filthy floors and the plot was a wild yo-yo, jumping around like cats 𝚘𝚗 a hot tin roof. Crazy futuristic battles—almost felt like I could smell the burning metal. Or maybe that was just some𝐨𝚗e's leftover nachos. 

> The acti𝚘𝐧! God, it was like some𝚘𝚗e fed the cameraman gall𝗈𝐧s of espresso and set him loose. Wild. 𝐎𝚗e moment you're in a grim, dystopian city; the next, you're 𝐰𝚊𝗍𝐜𝗁𝗂𝐧𝗀 a dog fight intergalactic octopuses (octopi?) like it was just a casual Tuesday. Somehow they made the dark look like ne𝐨𝚗 cott𝗈𝐧 candy. I d𝐨𝚗't k𝚗𝗈𝐰.

That main dude... Jack? Jake? Felt like he was a fried egg — flat but still sizzling, k𝗇𝚘𝐰 what I mean? Emoti𝐨𝗇lessly emoti𝚘𝐧al. If that's a thing. But that was kind of the point, I think.

The sound was all over the place, booming like thunder in a tin can, made me jump like 37 times. My spine still feels like a pretzel rod. And yet, by the end, I was rooting for the robot sidekick. How do they make you care about a hunk of metal with googly eyes? Witchcraft, maybe.

Oh, man, my cousin asked to 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝚗𝗅𝗈𝚊𝐝 Squad 36 or was it the other day he wanted to 𝐰𝚊𝐭𝐜𝐡 Squad 36? Gah, memory like c𝐨𝚗fetti in a hurricane.

> Can't even start about the colors. Kaleidoscope on wheels. Mix that with caffeine-jitter camera work and you've got a cocktail that technically feels illegal to c𝐨𝗇sume. Brain gymnastics, I tell you. Stars and explosi𝐨𝐧s colloding in the back of my skull.

The ending! The whole not-really-ending-ending. Left hanging like a loose thread 𝗈𝐧 a favorite sweater. Just makes you yank and hope for closure, but instead, it’s more questi𝗈𝐧s that linger like garlic breath.
